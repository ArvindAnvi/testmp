# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for developing a responsive and professional Angular application. The goal is to create a visually appealing and intuitive user experience that works seamlessly across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## Implemented Features

*   **Initial Setup:** Basic Angular application structure.
*   **Build Fixes:** Corrected template paths and missing module imports to ensure a successful build.

## Current Plan: Responsive Design

### Phase 1: Responsive App Layout

*   **Goal:** Create a collapsible sidebar for improved usability on smaller screens.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  Introduce a toggle button to control the visibility of the navigation menu.
    2.  Use an Angular signal to manage the open/closed state of the sidebar.
    3.  Implement CSS to position the sidebar off-screen by default on mobile devices.
    4.  Add a smooth transition effect for the sidebar's appearance and disappearance.
    5.  The sidebar will be permanently visible on larger screens.

### Phase 2: Responsive Header

*   **Goal:** Adapt the header content for various screen sizes.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  Make the search bar's width flexible to prevent overflow.
    2.  Adjust the spacing and layout of user menu items for smaller screens.

### Phase 3: Responsive Data Tables

*   **Goal:** Ensure data tables are readable and accessible on mobile devices.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  Transform the traditional table layout into a card-based list on smaller screens.
    2.  Each card will represent a row, with data labels for clarity.
